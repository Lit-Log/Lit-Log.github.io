            <p>
                I used to have many friends. Used to.
            </p>
            <h3>My friends were annihilated [probably]</h3>
            <p>
                We were called the Falcon Mission. And there were 49 of us each on a starship. The Falcon Mission is the toughest, the most advanced,
                and the coolest starship team in the universe. Or was? Or it still maybe is?
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Starman. I was in the Falcon Heavy. The biggest starship
                of the Falcon Mission.    
            </p>
            <p>
                We were all friends in the Falcon Mission despite we don't really talk
                much with each other. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, we have this assignment, called <a href="http://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a>, to explore a blue bubble and the other
                things surrounding it. Well, it was our first assignment.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Anyway, we got trapped on this big blue bubble. This blue bubble has tremendous force that keeps us from escaping it, but also,
                it was disturbingly shrinking, and its surroundings were getting darker and darker by
                the minute, and it seems like it's going to burst anytime soon. We do not know for how long would
                it take for us to escape before it actually bursts. And when it bursts,
                it would be the end of us.
            </p>

                SpaceX CRS-7 disintegrating two minutes after liftoff, as seen 
                from a NASA tracking camera 
                <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches#/media/File:SpaceX_CRS-7_launch_failure.jpg">(SpaceX, 2015)</a></b>.
            </p>
            <p>
               Escape is the only solution. One by one our ships tried to climb up and escape
               the bubble. But instead, many of those who struggled up eventually ran out of
               fuel, recoiled and were instead pulled downward by the bubble's force.
               Unfortunately, they are lost inside it. Unseen. Unheard of.
            </p>
            <p>
               However, we knew a few who went outside like 8, 11, and 12. They radioed us on
               what to do to get out. But as they were outside, they told us that they are uncontrollably shifting farther
               and farther towards the void and soon enough we lost contact with them.
            </p>
            <p>
               Now we don't know what else had happened. And as an old saying goes
               "pessima expectatis; speramus optima" or "expect the worst; hope for the
               best." we assumed the worst had happened. But getting out is our only chance of survival. No matter 
               what uncertainty awaits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite of the advises given to us by those who managed to escape, 
                few only succeeded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now as the pilot of the biggest ship of the Falcons, it took me a long time to prepare.
                Everyone already went before me. And I realized I was the only one left 
                in the bubble.
            </p>
            <p>
                Too bad. My turn (to screw up?).
            </p>
            <h3>My turn</h3>
            <p>
                The moment of truth. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am the only one that's left of the Falcons, as far as I know. It's now
                up to me for the Falcons (or what's left of it) to get the hell out of this
                God-forsaken place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just before I started my struggle to get out of the blue bubble, I received
                a distress call on the communications gear. It was gibberish except for some words like &QUOT;red,&QUOT;
                &QUOT;spot,&QUOT; and &QUOT;nearest.&QUOT; The distress call carries an
                electronic signature similar or one of those used by us, Falcons.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that, I've set course to a red spot at a vast empty void and it is the one
                seemingly near that fills it. </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Now, as I start my climb, away from the bubble, I felt this nerve-wrecking
                feeling that something's going to go wrong. Perhaps I have seen too
                many Falcons fail and that gives me the anxiety I feel now. Or was
                it just anxiety? Or is my gut-feeling right?
            </p>
            <p>
                How I wish I was wrong.
            </p>
            <h3>Trouble</h3>
            <p>
                What could possibly go wrong? Well, I'd be damned. 
            </p>

            <p>
                So my ship has only 3 boosters. The Heavy core, a Type 1023.2, and 
                a Type 1025.2 booster. And what went wrong is the Heavy core. Of all the
                boosters. The core went wrong. It ran out of triethylaluminum-triethylborane
                (TEA-TEM) fuel which was needed to have the right trajectory towards
                the red object spotted in the vast void. And the chance of getting
                out of this bubble has decreased. But there still remains a slim chance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon thereafter, all fuel had ran out. Sooner than expected. The force
                of the bubble is still upon me. Now to reduce its pull, I had to get
                rid of all the booster thus reducing my ship's weight. But still it was not
                enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apparently, the only choice left is to use <i>the Roadster</i>

                SpaceX Successfully Launches Tesla Roadster and a Dummy Named Starman into Space
                <b><a href="https://blog.caranddriver.com/spacex-successfully-launches-tesla-roadster-and-a-dummy-named-starman-into-space-video/">(Stoklosa, A., 2018)</a></b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes. I've kept a car in the cargo bay of the ship. Because why not?
                Plus, it's small enough to not be affected by the force of the bubble.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, cruising out of the cargo bay, I and the Roadster, are now free
                of the bubble and its force.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there's just one problem. I got no ship. And any means to navigate
                to the red spot on the void is gone. And any probability to rendezvous 
                with other Falcons is gone.
            </p>
            <h3>
                It's Over. Shoot. Overshoot.
            </h3>
            <p>
                It was a failure. And a success at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                A failure that not all went into plan despite all the preparation,
                motivation, and calculations. But what made it a success is that despite
                hopelessness, I have been able to do my main objective which was to get
                out of that bubble which made me its prisoner.
            </p>
            <p>
                After calculating my trajectory manually, my fate is now sealed towards
                a pile of rocks scattered across the endless void.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Now that I have made my escape with this car, might as well enjoy the joyride and have a toast for my old friends.
