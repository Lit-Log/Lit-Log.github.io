                    <h1>Oedipus Rex <br> Casted with Irony;<br> Irony Casted by It</h1>
                    <h5>by <a>Kristofer Sano</a> January 25, 2018</h5>
                </div>

            <p>Greece, one of the cradles of civilization, fostered the maestro Sophocles
            who in turn shaped the way tragedy and irony was made through the ages.
            One of his work that really stood out not only from other great works of his time 
            but also throughout history was Oedipus Rex or also known as Oedipus the King.
            It has never before seen and thought of to be the most tragic tragedy, 
            and ironic irony of all time. 
            </p>
            <p>Never before had dramatic irony been portrayed best as the story of 
                Oedipus, and now, it is the framework of following ironies and tragedies
                after its birth. The story started out with what seemed to be
                a normal scenario, with a noble protagonist. Then came
                a drastic problem, the drought, that required a drastic solution. 
                However, the solution is another problem to solve. And as  the story unravels,
                the answer has not been what Oedipus had in mind. He himself. Not 
                only that but also with a realization of who he is, and what he became.
                That he became his father's killer and his mother's wife. Nowadays, 
                many literary artworks, albeit with differing storylines, follow the
                same flow of first having relatable actor(s) or actress(es), then with a
                storyline progression slowly showing glimpses of a grim truth, then 
                finally showing the ugly end.
            </p>
            <p>Oedipus Rex's entire story is an irony: he who fought the Sphinx
                was not able to fight off the drought; having 
                his own mother as his own wife; his quest as a nobleman in persecuting the murderer 
                of Laius, ended up with him persecuting his own self; and calling the blind prophet Teresias
                blind but only he saw the reality Oedipus is living in. 
            </p>
            <p>In addition, what makes the Oedipus Rex exemplary is that it conveys
                meaning and values through its irony. Such as Oedipus, despite unknowingly living a lie,
                continued his pursuit of truth. No matter what other people insist, and
                how terrible the truth is for him and to the people close to him. 
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the Oedipus Rex not only changed how artists create 
                literary works but also the way of thinking of people throughout the 
                ages.

            <h3>Who is Sophocles?</h3>
            <p>Sophocles is the playwright of famous literary artworks such as 
                <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(Sophocles)'>Ajax</a>,
                <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigone_(Sophocles_play)'>Antigone</a>,

                <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electra_(Sophocles_play)'>Electra</a>.
                A tragedian who pioneered the use of a third actor in a play, reducing
                the role of the chorus. He innovated the way plays were created in 
                such a way to have a more interesting storyline and effect to the audience.
