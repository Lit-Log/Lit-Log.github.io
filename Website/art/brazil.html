            <p>A plane carrying members of a Brazilian football team, Chapecoense, has crashed in Colombia, killing 71 people according to the Colombian aviation authorities.</p>
            <img src="../pic/brazil1.jpg" class="oimg">
            <p class="cptn">
                Crash site in Colombia where 77 were killed, most are with Chapecoense Team, 5 badly injured
            </p>
            <p>Six others survived, including three players.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The charter aircraft, carrying 77 people, came down in a mountainous area outside Medellin at about 10.15pm local time.</p>
            <p>It was later confirmed to be&nbsp;carrying members of the Brazil Serie A side, who were scheduled to play in the Copa Sudamerica finals against Atletico National in Medellin on Wednesday.</p>
            <p>Access to the crash site had&nbsp;been difficult because of heavy rain, causing the rescue operation to be suspended in the early hours of Tuesday morning.</p>
            <p>It has been confirmed that Chapecoense&nbsp;defender, 27-year-old Alan Ruschel, is one of the five survivors.</p>
            <p>Concerning the player's condition, a doctor said: "We still don't have a final diagnosis.</p>
            <p>"We are waiting for lab results and X-rays to make a decision and do a (surgical) procedure."</p>
            <p>Colombian authorities also named the two other&nbsp;footballers who survived as Jakson Follmann and Neto.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Another player, goalkeeper Danilo, had initially survived too, but later died.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In a statement on its Facebook page, the club said: "May God accompany our athletes, officials, journalists and other guests travelling with our delegation."</p>
            <p>"There are a lot of people crying in our city. We could never imagine this.</p>
            <p>"Chapecoense is the biggest reason for joy here."&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A Chapecoense player who has been sidelined through injury and was not on the flight, Alejandro Martinuccio, said: "I feel profound sadness.</p>
            <p>"The only thing I can ask is prayers for the companions who were on the flight."</p>
            <p>The plane had declared an emergency due to power failure before losing contact with the control tower.</p>
            <p>Atletico Nacional has tweeted to express its sympathies. The South American football federation has suspended all games following the news from Colombia.</p>
            <p>The president of Brazil, Michel Temer, has declared three days of mourning.</p>
            <p>"I express my solidarity in this sad hour during which tragedy has beset dozens of Brazilian families," he said.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>"The government will do all it can to alleviate the pain of the friends and family of sport and national journalism."&nbsp;</p>
            <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement: "This is a very, very sad day for football.</p>
            <p>"At this difficult time our thoughts are with the victims, their families and friends.</p>
            <p>"FIFA would like to extend its most heartfelt condolences to the fans of Chapecoense, the football community and media organizations concerned in Brazil."</p>
            <p>The mayor of Medellin, Federico Gutierrez, said: "It's a regrettable situation.</p>
            <p>"I can confirm that this is the plane where the players were and right now we are following the events.</p>
            <p>"We have the necessary team coming from Medellin - ambulances, medical staff - and the important thing here is to understand that there are survivors and we are saving lives.</p>
            <p>"We are doing all we can in this very regrettable and sad situation."&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Who are the Chapecoense?</h3>
            <p>Chapecoense were founded in 1973 in the city of Chapeco, in the state of Santa Caterina, southern Brazil.</p>
            <p>They had recently broken into the top tier of Brazilian football and were preparing to play in their first final of South America's major club competition.</p>
            <p>The team went on to win the state championship within a few years, and would add a few more. But big-league football eluded them for a long time.</p>
            <p>Then, in 2014, it entered Brazil's first division, the Serie A, for the first time since the 1970s, and this year it made the finals of the Copa Sudamericana - South America's equivalent of the Europa League.</p>
